# Time Series Analysis & Forecasting

### Learning Outcomes:

1. Identify different components of a time series: trend, seasonality, white noise. Decompose and visualize these components.
2. De-trending and de-seasonalizing data using various methods as box-cox transformations, differencing and double differencing and other transformations 
3. Identifying if data is stationary or non-stationary 
4. Transforming a time-series to make it stationary 
5. Applying forecasting techniques on a time-series for prediction. 
6. Building and interpreting auto-correlation plots for stationary/ non-stationary data.
7. Examining residual data for white noise or information 
8. Perform testing such as Box.test to validate residuals as white noise. 
9. Generate and interpret ARIMA models. 
10. Identify a good ARIMA model based on metrics such as aic, bic and aicc.
